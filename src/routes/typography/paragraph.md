<CompoDescription>
  Use the paragraph component to create multiple blocks of text separated by blank lines and write
  content based on multiple layouts and styles
</CompoDescription>

<ExampleDiv>
  <GitHubSource href="buttongroups/P.svelte">P</GitHubSource>
  <GitHubSource href="buttongroups/Layout.svelte">Layout</GitHubSource>
</ExampleDiv>

The paragraph element is one of the most commonly used HTML tags on a document page because it is
used to write longer blocks of text separated by a blank line and can massively improve the on-page
SEO of the page when used correctly. Get started with a collection of paragraph components based on
multiple styles, layouts, colors and sizes to use for your website.

<Htwo label="Default paragraph" />

Use this example of a paragraph element to use inside article content or a landing page.

<ExampleDiv>
  <P class="mb-3" weight="light" color="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    Track work across the enterprise through an open, collaborative platform. Link issues across
    Jira and ingest data from other software development tools, so your IT support and operations
    teams have richer contextual information to rapidly respond to requests, incidents, and changes.
  </P>
  <P weight="light" color="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    Deliver great service experiences fast - without the complexity of traditional ITSM solutions.
    Accelerate critical development work, eliminate toil, and deploy changes with ease, with a
    complete audit trail for every change.
  </P>
</ExampleDiv>

```html
<P class="mb-3" weight="light" color="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
  Track work across the enterprise through an open ...
</P>
<P weight="light" color="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
  Deliver great service experiences fast - without the ...
</P>
```

<Htwo label="Leading paragraph" />

The leading text can be used as the first paragraph inside an article content page.

<ExampleDiv>
  <P class="mb-3 md:text-xl" weight="light" size="lg" color="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400"
    >Deliver great service experiences fast - without the complexity of traditional ITSM
    solutions.Accelerate critical development work and deploy.
  </P>
  <P weight="light" color="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400"
    >Track work across the enterprise through an open, collaborative platform. Link issues across
    Jira and ingest data from other software development tools, so your IT support and operations
    teams have richer contextual information to rapidly respond to requests, incidents, and changes.
  </P>
</ExampleDiv>

```html
<P class="mb-3 md:text-xl" weight="light" size="lg" color="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
  Deliver great service experiences fast - without ...
</P>
<P weight="light" color="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
  Track work across the enterprise through an open ...
</P>
```

<Htwo label="First letter" />

Use `firstupper` prop to highlight the first letter of the paragraph, often used in e-books and PDF
documents.

<ExampleDiv>
  <P class="mb-3" color="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400" firstupper
    >Track work across the enterprise through an open, collaborative platform. Link issues across
    Jira and ingest data from other software development tools, so your IT support and operations
    teams have richer contextual information to rapidly respond to requests, incidents, and changes.</P>
  <P weight="light" color="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400"
    >Deliver great service experiences fast - without the complexity of traditional ITSM
    solutions.Accelerate critical development work, eliminate toil, and deploy changes with ease,
    with a complete audit trail for every change.</P>
</ExampleDiv>

```html
<P class="mb-3" color="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400" firstupper>
  Track work across the enterprise through an open ...
</P>
<P weight="light" color="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
  Deliver great service experiences fast - without the ...
</P>
```

<Htwo label="Paragraph link" />

This example can be used to add a custom styled link element inside the paragraph.

<ExampleDiv>
  <P weight="light" color="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    Track work across the enterprise through an open, collaborative platform. <A href="/"
      >Link issues across Jira</A> and ingest data from other software development tools, so your IT
    support and operations teams have richer contextual information to rapidly respond to requests, incidents,
    and changes.
  </P>
</ExampleDiv>

```html
<P weight="light" color="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
  Track work ... <A href="/">Link issues across Jira</A> and ingest data from other ...
</P>
```


<Htwo label="Paragraph bold" />

Use this example to highlight a piece of text inside the paragraph by using a bolder font weight.

<ExampleDiv>
  <P class="mb-3" weight="light" color="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    Track work across the enterprise through an open, collaborative platform. <strong
      class="font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">Link issues across Jira</strong> and ingest
    data from other software development tools, so your IT support and operations teams have richer contextual
    information to rapidly respond to requests, incidents, and changes.
  </P>
</ExampleDiv>

```html
<P class="mb-3" weight="light" color="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
  Track work ... <strong class="font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">Link issues across Jira</strong> and ingest ...
</P>
```

<Htwo label="Paragraph underline" />

This example can be used to underline a certain part of the text inside the paragraph.

<ExampleDiv>
  <P class="mb-3" weight="light" color="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    Track work across the enterprise through an open, collaborative platform. <u class="underline"
      >Link issues across Jira</u>
    and ingest data from other software development tools, so your IT support and operations teams have
    richer contextual information to rapidly respond to requests, incidents, and changes.
  </P>
</ExampleDiv>

```html
<P class="mb-3" weight="light" color="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
  Track work ... <u class="underline">Link issues across Jira</u> and ingest ...
</P>
```

<Htwo label="Paragraph italic" />

Use this example to make the font style of the text inside the paragraph italic.

<ExampleDiv>
  <P class="mb-3" weight="light" color="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    Track work across the enterprise through an open, collaborative platform. <em
      class="font-italic">Link issues across Jira</em>
    and ingest data from other software development tools, so your IT support and operations teams have
    richer contextual information to rapidly respond to requests, incidents, and changes.
  </P>
</ExampleDiv>

```html
<P class="mb-3" weight="light" color="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
  Track work ... <em class="font-italic">Link issues across Jira</em>
  and ingest ...
</P>
```

<Htwo label="Paragraph popover" />

Get started with this example to show a popover with extra information inside paragraph elements.

<ExampleDiv class="flex items-end h-96">
  <P weight="font-light" color="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400"
    >Due to its central geographic location in Southern Europe, <A href="/" id="popover-image"
